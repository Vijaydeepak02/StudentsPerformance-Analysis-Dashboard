# StudentsPerformance-Analysis-Dashboard
In this project, I have designed a dashboard consisting of seven objectives using  the Students Performance dataset.  The reason for choosing this Students Performance dataset is basically marks  which show level of thinking of students to correct themselves. While searching  for the dataset, I came across many datasets but I felt this Students Performance topic was something interesting and unique. So, I chose this as my dataset. I have listed all my seven objectives below: - 1) Classification of group w.r.t gender. 2) Count of parental level of education w.r.t gender. 3) Count of types of lunch w.r.t gender and group. 4) Test preparation course by gender. 5) Top 3 maths score w.r.t groups. 6) Top 3 reading score w.r.t groups. 7) Top 3 writings score w.r.t groups.
